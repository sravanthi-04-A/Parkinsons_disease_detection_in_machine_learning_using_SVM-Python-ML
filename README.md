#  Parkinson’s Disease Detection Using SVM

##  Overview

This project focuses on detecting Parkinson’s Disease using a supervised machine learning approach.  
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on biomedical voice measurement data to predict whether a patient has Parkinson’s Disease.

The objective is to build a reliable, non-invasive early detection model using structured data analysis and classification techniques.

##  Problem Statement

Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and speech patterns. Early detection plays an important role in improving treatment outcomes.

This project aims to:

- Perform data preprocessing and feature analysis  
- Train and optimize an SVM model  
- Evaluate classification performance  
- Visualize prediction results using evaluation metrics

##  Dataset Information

- The dataset consists of biomedical voice measurements.
- Each row represents an individual patient.
- Features include frequency measures, vocal jitter, shimmer, and other speech-related attributes.
- The target variable indicates:
  - `1` → Parkinson’s Disease present  
  - `0` → Healthy
